# Allium Effect (Bedrock)

*For the original work for Java Edition, please see <https://github.com/sheep-realms/Allium-Effect>.*

----

This is a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition resource pack that incorporates various allium-like elements.

This resource pack was from a joke. It replaces items such as redstone with an appearance similar to allium.

## Note

As background information, in Chinese:
- **Allium** is translated as "**绒球葱**" (róngqiú cōng, *literally "Velvet Ball Scallion"*) in Minecraft (Simplified Chinese only).
- "**葱**" (cōng) can be roughly translated as "scallion", but it usually refers to the plant [*Allium fistulosum*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allium_fistulosum) (commonly known as the **Welsh onion** in English).
- "**花**" (huā) means "flower", but also refers to something small and fragmentary. So, "**葱花**" (cōnghuā), literally "Scallion Flower", actually means "chopped scallions".

Some Minecraft Wiki editors discovered that its translation was once incorrectly called "葱球绒" (cōng qiú róng, *literally "Scallion Ball Velvet"*) or "绒葱球" (róng cōng qiú, *literally "Velvet Scallion Ball"*) by some people. This sparked a "debate" about whether Allium was more like an scallion (for eating) or a flower (for viewing), and it was eventually identified as "葱花" as a joke.

This phenomenon is somewhat similar to the Mandela effect, that is, the phenomenon that collective memory does not conform to historical facts. For this reason, we came up with the “Allium Effect”, which is the name of this resource pack.

After a series of allium jokes and memes appeared, a lot of allium-related content began to spread virally in the group. Since it is very difficult to translate the homophones, we cannot go into details here. An example of the jokes in English is calling "*all*ium" "*any*ium".

[sheep-realms](https://github.com/sheep-realms) originally made a resource pack for Java Edition, and I decided to port it to Bedrock Edition.

This is the story behind this resource pack.
